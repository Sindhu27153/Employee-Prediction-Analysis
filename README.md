# Employee Attrition Prediction

A machine learning project to analyze and predict employee attrition based on various factors such as job satisfaction, work environment, and personal attributes.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Feature selection and engineering
- Model training and evaluation
- Attrition prediction and insights visualization

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/sindhu27153/employee-attrition-prediction.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd employee-attrition-prediction
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the analysis using:
```sh
python main.py
```
Follow the on-screen instructions to preprocess data, train models, and generate predictions.

## How It Works
1. Load and preprocess the employee dataset.
2. Perform exploratory data analysis to identify key attrition factors.
3. Train machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) on historical data.
4. Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. Predict whether an employee is likely to leave based on input features.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
